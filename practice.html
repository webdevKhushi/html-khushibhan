    <p>Hello there my name is Khushi Bhan. I'm doing electrical engineering from PEC Chandigarh.I always wanted 
        to do something big in my life and I really worked hard to be at this postion.The path was not easy..But 
        I really did it. Now I can say that I am doing that things in my life in which I have the interest.
        So, now the question arises how did I really came to know that in which domain do I have the interest.
        In the starting of my college life I was not much into studies but as the year passed I realised that
        electrical is one of the hardest branch of the engineering. I was one of the bright student in my school
        always in the top 50 merit students.But in college, I was really disappointed regrading my degrading grades
        I used to think about my future and would get worried..But then I explored that I have a keen interest
        in coding, so I started doing coding. I learned python and C++. I started doing DSA and just start loving
        spending my time sitting in front of my laptop for hours doing coding and exploring more.
        Then I started learning WEB DEVLOPMENT side my side.I'm still looking forward to learn and explore more.

        But the worst part not to start the journey thinking:"What if I get failed!""
